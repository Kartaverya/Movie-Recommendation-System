# Movie-Recommendation-System  ðŸŽ¬

This is a simple content-based movie recommendation system I built using Python and pandas. It suggests similar movies based on the one you input by comparing genres, cast, crew, and keywords.

### Whatâ€™s inside

- Jupyter notebook with the code and explanation
- Datasets: `movies_metadata.csv` and `links_small.csv`

## How it works

- It uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to figure out which movies are most similar based on the metadata.
- Just enter a movie name, and itâ€™ll show you some that are similar.

## Example:  
Input: The Dark Knight
Output: Batman Begins, The Prestige, Inception, etc.


## Tech used
